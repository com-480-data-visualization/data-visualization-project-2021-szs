[Milestone 1](#milestone-1) • [Milestone 2](#milestone-2) • [Milestone 3](#milestone-3)

## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

We based our data exploratory analysis and visualization mainly on the league, team and player point of view, and thus have concluded the following findings. The variation of data along time has also been studied on the three levels.

- From the historical point of view:
 -- From the season 2008/2009 to 2015/2016, the number of matches and total participating teams remains roughly constant over time, the average is 3247 and 185 respectively.
 - In leagues, the proportion of the number of teams participating in the season to the total number of teams is basically between 55-70%. And this statistic remains roughly unchanged over time. The proportion reaches its highest value in the case of Belgium Jupiler League in season 2008/2009, which is 75%. Interestingly, it drops dramatically in season 2013/2014 due to missing data, which is merely 16.7%, and returns to normal in the next two seasons.
 - 92 teams participated in all the seasons, and 51 teams participated only once, accounting for 31% and 17% of all teams respectively. Besides, the number of teams participating twice to seven times is similar, accounting for 8.6% of all teams in average.
- From the team point of view:
 - Juventus from Italy Serie A got 102 pts in season 2013/2014, the highest pts in history. And the teams which obtained the top five low pts in history are all from Belgium Jupiler League.
 - Celtic and FC Barcelona are the only two teams that enter the top 10 Pts every season. FC Barcelona is the team that won the most champions, which is four times in eight seasons. 
 - FC Barcelona, Real Madrid CF and Celtic are the top 3 high average Pts teams.
 - The best new team in history is Manchester United. It won 90 pts in the 2008/2009 season.
 - There are 34 teams with the largest number of matches, which is 304. While the smallest number of matches is 30, obtained by 6 teams.
 - The team is more likely to win as a home team rather than an away team, with more average team goals in the match.
- From the player point of view:
 - For all players, the average height is 181.87cm and average weight 168.38g. The average age in their participating seasons is about 25 and remains almost the same over time.
 - About 75.7% of the players prefer to play with the right foot and 23.5% play with the right one.
 - Lionel Messi has the highest overall rating , which is 94, and has kept it for four seasons.

> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
